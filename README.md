# OSHA data import and processing

This repository consists of two main scripts for downloading, parsing and geocoding CSV files on inspection, violation and accident records from OSHA's website. For a full list of files, click 'Enforcement data' on this page: https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_catalogs.php.

## Installation

These scripts are built in Python 2.7. After pulling the repository into a directory called osha, you should create a virtual environment in which to run everything.

``` 
virtualenv ENV
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
